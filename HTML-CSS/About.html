            <p><i>Blessed Streets is a clothing and tech-style company managed
                by me Aaron J. Hunte, sole trader. We are located Downtown,
                Port of Spain opposite Excellence Stores. Blessed Streets
                provides customers with designer, casual and formal clothing.
                Our products are locally made.
                Customer service is top-notch, for we have acquired an amazing
                staff whose only goal is to make customers feel at home. We also
                encourage customers to take part in various activities; one of our
                famous games is ‘Jump Shot Thursdays’, where customers who
                purchase products can test them out in our indoor half-court gym.
                Both positive and negative feedback is welcomed, as we strive to
                better ourselves as a business and make our customers happy.
                We target persons who are looking for top quality products but
                don’t have the money to purchase them at crazy prices. Our
